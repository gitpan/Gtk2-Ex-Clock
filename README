Gtk2::Ex::Clock is a simple digital clock widget displaying an
strftime formatted time or date/time.  The default is 24-hour %H:%M
local time, and properties allow other formats and/or a different
timezone.  Pango markup can be used for font effects like bold or
italics in the display.

The only prerequisite is Gtk2-Perl.  The clock home page is
