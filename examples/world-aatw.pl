=head1 NAME

world-aatw.pl -- sample program displaying DateTimeX::AATW clocks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ./world-aatw.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a bit of fun showing timezones around the world picked out by the
C<DateTimeX::AATW> "all around the world" module.  You must have it and
C<DateTime::TimeZone> to run this program.

Depending on how fast your computer is, C<DateTimeX::AATW> may take a few
seconds churning through the zones finding offsets.  In a real program you
could display a waiting message or something, but here it's just takes a
moment to start.
